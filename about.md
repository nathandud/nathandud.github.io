## My Story
While on holiday in Queenstown, New Zealand in early 2023, I woke up in our rented campervan to a text from a co-worker friend back in the United States.

> Were you affected?

The next message in my inbox was from an uknown number.

> Hi. I'm sorry to inform you that we've decided to restructure...

Up until that moment I had felt very secure in my career, lifestyle, and financial trajectory.
The five-year-plan *was* progressing smoothly. Admittedly, that feeling of *security* also led to **complacency**.
As anyone who's been on the job market recently can tell you - there is no room for complacency.

Applying for jobs became my job. Each passing day was like a progressively louder clock announcing the end of our financial runway. During one particularly grueling day scouring LinkedIn, a silly thought crossed my mind:

> I wonder if there any open roles in New Zealand.

Well it turns out that New Zealand has its own less-hellish version of LinkedIn called [Seek](https://www.seek.co.nz).
Of the three postings for mobile developers, only **one** lacked the requirement 
for an applicant to hold a current visa (*side-note: I later found out this ommission was accidental.)*
After a 15-second consultation with my partner, the consensus was *"why not just apply?"*. The company and the role looked
interesting, and its objective was something far more meaningful than any place I'd worked prior. So I mixed a little extra
love into the cover letter, customized the rÃ©sumÃ© (CV), and sent the application across the Pacific fully expecting to hear nothing back.

Another three weeks passed and the initial wave of applications were either officially rejected or simply ignored. During that time I received a message from someone at [Alimetry](https://www.alimetry.com). The company name seemed vaguely familiar, and it took me a half-a-minute to realize it was the little New Zealand startup I had already moved to the "Ghosted" column of on my 
job board. As I began the interview process, I constantly tampered my expectations as I progressed through each stage.

| The Company | My Internal Monologue |
|-|-|
| We're seeing if we can hire outisde country | They definitely won't hire outside country |
| We received the go-ahead to interview you | They will find someone local for cheaper |
| We were impressed by your interview | They said that to at least five other people  |
| We're progressing with you as our preferred candidate | They will change their minds |
| We're offering you the job | ðŸ˜® |

I applied for a visa as quickly as possible and within two months we sold our home in Dallas and moved to New Zealand.
Now I've taken over development of an iPad app that helps patients with severe stomach illness. The company
is growing and I feel lucky to work alongside brilliant colleagues who are dedicated to their craft. Sometimes I can
even feel a little out-of-place among all the doctorates.

## What now?
The pace is slower
here - most shops close at 5 PM and restaurants at 9 PM. The elementary school will take the kids on impromptu walks to the
beach if dolphins or orcas are reported. I mostly work from home, but will take a ferry ride into the city once
a week.

Due to stricter labor laws in New Zealand, I'm objectively more secure in this job than any before it. It's
safe to say I am *content*, but I want to avoid being **complacent** - so I'm doing what I've been putting off 
for years: building something on my own. Despite writing software for years at my day job, I don't have anything to
showcase. I'm setting out to change that by doing the following:

1. Releasing an iOS app to the App Store
2. Building and marketing a hardware product
3. Blogging about it on a website
